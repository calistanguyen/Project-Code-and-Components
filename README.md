# Tender 
Tender is an online web application designed to help college students figure out what to eat. Inspired from our indecision, Tender
is your online dating web app for recipes. The home page generates random recipe cards that you can choose to save to your inventory, see
a new recipe, or go directly to the recipe's page. If you create an account, your saved recipes are stored in your profile so that
you are able to view them another time. 

In this project, we utilized PostgreSQL for our database server, NodeJS, JWT, and Spoonacular.
