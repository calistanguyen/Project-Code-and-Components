    <!--I'm not entirely sure in this context how we would be able to set the same information into different bins, so for now things in the bottom area share the same ID's as in the card section. I didn't write any of the ajax API call things since I know you have spent some time looking at spoonacular things. For adding a list of cards, I'm thinking we just do something almost exactly like the cards in Lab9. -->
